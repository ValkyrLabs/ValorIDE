## What is Valor IDE?

Valor IDE is your **agentic coding companion** inside VS Code.\
Unlike traditional "autocomplete" assistants, Valor IDE can actually **use your CLI and Editor** ‚Äî giving it hands-on power to build, debug, and ship your code alongside you.

Built on **ThorAPI's secure generation engine** and **Claude Opus agentic capabilities**, Valor IDE is more than code completion:

- It analyzes your project with **AST parsing, regex search, and source tree exploration**.
- It edits files, fixes errors, installs dependencies, and runs commands.
- It can **launch a browser**, click around, capture console logs/screenshots, and fix UI bugs.
- It extends itself with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to add brand-new tools.
- Every action is **human-in-the-loop**: you approve edits and commands, keeping safety + control in your hands.

**In short: Valor IDE is the future of coding‚Äîaccessible, agentic, and always under your command.**

---

## How It Works

1. **Define a Task**
   - Example: "Fix this bug" or "Convert this mockup into a working app."
   - You can even add screenshots or errors from your workspace.

2. **Valor IDE Gathers Context**
   - Scans your project structure.
   - Reads files and ASTs.
   - Decides what's relevant without overwhelming the context window.

3. **Agentic Execution**
   - Creates/edits files with diffs.
   - Runs commands in your terminal and adapts to live output.
   - For web projects, launches a headless browser to test/debug.

4. **Review & Approve**
   - You see the diffs. You approve or revert.
   - Valor IDE learns and continues until the task is complete.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P` shortcut to open the command palette and type "ValorIDE: Open In New Tab" to open the extension as a tab in your editor. This lets you use ValorIDE side-by-side with your file explorer, and see how he changes your workspace more clearly.

## Core Features

### üîó Use Any API & Model

Valor IDE connects to model apis to perform AI-powered code generation and other tasks.

Valor integrates with almost any LLM model api including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, GCP Vertex, or local models (Ollama / LM Studio).\

Valor also can connect to ValkyrAI models that you can customize and train to your specific environment, project, and business needs.

It also tracks **token usage and costs** across entire task loops, so you always know your spend.

---

### üîó Use Customized Models for Projects

Valor IDE integrates with ValkyrAI models that you can customize and configure for your specific needs.

Adjust the initial prompt with technical details specific to your project(s) and business(es) to save time and maximize efficiency and effectiveness.

Using Valor P2P you can configure a management Model and a work execution Model and run a supervised project right within your IDE.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Valhalla Suite / ThorAPI

Valor IDE integrates with the rest of the Valhalla Suite from Valkyr Labs -- ThorAPI generated backend apis, Typescript (and other) client libraries and components.

**Full Application Generation:**

- Generate complete applications from OpenAPI specifications
- Poll generation status and download completed projects
- Configurable ThorAPI output folders via `.valoride/config`
- Seamless integration with generated Spring Boot backends and React frontends

ValkyrAI can be run as a service in your generated application stack, providing workflow automations, while built-in RBAC allows secure sharing of any object in the system.

Agentic reporting tracks **token usage and costs** across entire task loops, so you always know your spend and monetization features of the ValkyrLabs.com

### üõ†Ô∏è Valor P2P

P2P allows multiple Valor instances to communicate and orchestrate tasks together.

It's an innovative and fun way to increase the power of Valor in your IDE.

- Install packages, run builds, deploy, and test.
- Handle long-running servers with background monitoring.
- React dynamically to compile errors and environment issues.

---

### üìù Create & Edit Files

- Edits appear in VS Code's diff view.
- You can modify or reject changes instantly.
- Valor IDE proactively fixes syntax/linter/compiler errors.
- Every change is recorded in your file's **Timeline** for easy rollback.

---

### üåê Enhanced Browser Automation

With [Claude Sonnet's Computer Use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use):

- Launches a browser, clicks, types, scrolls.
- Captures screenshots and console logs.
- **Local Chrome Integration**: Connect to your existing Chrome browser for session-based debugging.
- **Browser Discovery**: Automatically detect and connect to running Chrome instances.
- Perfect for runtime debugging and fixing UI bugs.

[See Demo](https://x.com/sdrzn/status/1850880547825823989)

### üõ†Ô∏è Extend with MCP

Valor IDE can generate new **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** tools on the fly.\
Example prompts:

- `add a tool that fetches Jira tickets`
- `add a tool that manages AWS EC2s`
- `add a tool that pulls PagerDuty incidents`

**Advanced MCP Features:**
